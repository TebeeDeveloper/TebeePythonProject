III. Introduction to the Classical Enigma (Module Foundation)
-	Enigma was the cipher machine used by Nazi Germany in World War II.
-	This machine was of utmost importance in protecting internal information.
	Alan Turing & Bletchley Park successfully deciphered the code.
-	Components:
	-   Keyboard: Input.
	-   Plugboard/Steckerbrett: Exchanges initial characters, serving as one of the important encryption layers.
	-   Rotors/Walzen: [Usually 3-5 rotors] Performs substitution permutation.
	-   Reflector/Umkehrwalze: Ensures the reversibility of the cipher (if A is encoded as B, then B will be encoded as A), but is also a key factor preventing a character from being encoded as itself.
-	Operating Principle:
        Keyboard -> Plugboard -> Rotor 1, 2, 3 -> Reflector -> Rotor 3, 2, 1 -> Plugboard -> Lampboard.

IV. Module Introduction
-	Based on the classical Enigma principle, using 1000 rotors to increase the keyspace and complexity of decipherment.
-	Exclusive Architecture:
	-	Rotation Mechanism: This is called Double Stepping:
		-	When rotor n - 1 reaches the notch [Example: X]
		-	Rotor n rotates 1 step [Example: P 0->1 K]
	-	Dynamic Plugboard: The plugboard changes daily.
-	The estimated keyspace is 26^1000. It can be said that this is larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe.

V. Basic Usage Guide
1.	Encryption Guide:
-	from enigma.machine import EnigmaMachine # Must include.
-	mc = EnigmaMachine() # Machine initialization function.
-	mc.set_positions(Rotor positions) # Very important for decryption.
-	mc.encrypt_text(text to be encrypted) # Encryption function.
2.	Decryption Guide:
-	from enigma.machine import EnigmaMachine # Must include.
-	mc = EnigmaMachine() # This function is called and named mc for ease of use.
-	mc.set_positions(Rotor positions) # This is the important function; without the correct rotor positions, decryption is impossible.
-	mc.decrypt(text to be decrypted) # The inverse function of encrypt.
